"""MCP tools for StockTrim Inventory Management.

This module contains tool implementations that provide actions with side effects
for interacting with the StockTrim API.

Tool Organization:
------------------
- foundation/: Low-level, granular operations that map closely to API endpoints
- workflows/: High-level, intent-based tools that combine multiple operations (future)

Tool Registration Pattern:
--------------------------
Each tool module exports a register_tools(mcp) function that registers its tools
with the FastMCP instance. This avoids circular imports.

When adding new tool modules:
1. Create the new module in the appropriate directory
2. Define tools as regular async functions (no decorators)
3. Add a register_tools(mcp: FastMCP) function that calls mcp.tool() on each function
4. Import and call the registration function from this file
